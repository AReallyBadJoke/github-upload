My website is a tracker for one repetition maximum lifting data.  It will allow users to input what they lift as a one rep max.  
It will present the user their one rep max and a table with a percentage breakdown for use with programming based on percent of one rep max.

This website displays lifting information to the user.

Properties:
	Lift Name - string
	Date of one rep max - date
	one rep max - number
	Bumpper type - string - Imperial or Metric
	location - string
	Previous one rep max - number


What are examples of valid and invalid values for the properties?
